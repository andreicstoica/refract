export const DEMO_TEXT = `New routines. That‚Äôs the thing I keep circling. Bootcamp rhythm is ending soon‚Äîdaily check-ins, late night commits, constant chatter on Slack. After graduation, I‚Äôll have to build my own cadence again. No one setting the schedule. Just me. Exciting and a little scary.
Demo in less than two weeks. Time moves fast, but also slow. The app works in chunks. Each piece fine on its own, but together it‚Äôs still messy. Not a story yet. Needs arc. Needs one clear takeaway. Judges won‚Äôt remember the stack, they‚Äôll remember how it felt. That‚Äôs what keeps looping in my head: it has to feel good to use.
This morning I polished layout‚Äîfonts, spacing, little animations. For a second it felt slick, almost real. Then I broke the data sync. Classic. Two hours gone sideways. Fixed it, but left drained. Everyone else is riding the same wave‚Äîscreenshots, bugs, tired jokes. Whole cohort buzzing on stress and pride.
I keep circling the pitch. Ninety seconds. Show, not tell. Hook early, wow moment, clean close. Wrote it again. Fewer words. More clicks. Then realized‚Äîtoo many clicks. Judges won‚Äôt wait. Every extra step is a chance to lose them. Simplify.
Practiced once on Loom. Awkward. Too fast. Forgot to pause. Harder than coding. But watching back shows what lands, what drags. Tomorrow: cut one more feature, tighten flow, trust the basics. Not about showing everything. Just the one thing that matters.`;
